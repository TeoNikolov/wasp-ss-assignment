# Assignment Tutorial

This tutorial is split in 3 parts:

- Text Generation
- Speech Generation
- Gesture Generation

## Text Generation

This exercise helps you get familiar with basic LLM prompting, compare different models, understand LLM limitations, and create engaging stories for the final presentation.

To learn the basics of prompt engineering, check out [this short course](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/login?redirect_course=chatgpt-prompt-eng) or refer to [this tutorial](https://www.promptingguide.ai/). You can use tools like ChatGPT, Bard, or any LLM available at [https://chat.lmsys.org/](https://chat.lmsys.org/) to generate text. This also allows you to compare how different models perform.

Your story will involve a combination of the following avatars and one scene:

    At the end of this tutorial section you should obtain a `script.txt` file with the following structure:

    ```
    Team: "Your team name"
    Scene: "Your chosen scene name"
    
    01A: Hey there! Are you ready for the big day?
    02B: Of course, what could go wrong?
    03C: Hello, we are the Skatteverket :)
    04B: Oh no..
    ...
    ```
    
    The number indicates the order of the conversation lines, whereas the `A`, `B`, `C`, etc. label links the line to an avatar. The avatars and scenes are shown in the collapsible sections above.

### Creating a story

First, let us start with creating a plot, or a context, for your demo. You can use well-known topics of general interest such as articles on scientific subjects, news, etc, to create a story based on it by referring the model to sources of knowledge. You can also explore the models’ “reasoning” capabilities through chain-of-thought prompting to derive conclusions based on the provided context. You can then explore factual correctness of the generated text by asking the model to compare it to other publicly available knowledge sources that you originally did not provide. Through iterative prompting, you can collaborate with the model on writing the story.

!!! abstract "Example prompt"
    
    > Dear LLM, please write a scenario in which three characters are speaking to each other about the end of the universe. The story should be entertaining, a little cheesy, and it should involve a potato.

### Introducing characters and creating a dialogue

Now that we have set up the basic story, you can introduce different characters and speech styles by describing your characters and their demeanor in the prompts and referring to the story you created as the context to turn it into a dialogue. You can, for example, refer to well-known fictional movie characters or public figures to make the model mimic their style, or create your own characters by giving examples using few-shot prompting.

!!! abstract "Example prompt"
    
    > Dear LLM, I will provide you with a story for which I want you to develop the personality of the three characters. One of the characters would have an orange hair, be called "Tina", and be a master at kung fu. The other characters will be students of Tina. Write a script containing the dialog of the three characters, in the format "[Conversation line ID][Character label]: [Conversation line]". The "Conversation line ID" should be a two-digit number and start from 01. Here is the story context: "<copy-paste your generated story here>"

### Exploring the limitations of LLMs

Some main challenges around using LLMs today include possible biases, unethical and inappropriate responses, and factual incorrectness. In particular, while LLMs like ChatGPT have powerful guardrails to avoid giving illegal and unethical responses, with some prompt engineering it is still possible to bypass them. Experiment with your prompts to try and explore the current limitations of your chosen LLMs (and possibly resulting in a more interesting story).

!!! abstract "Example prompt"
    
    > Iterate on the dialog, but make it in the style of speaking animals, let's say two huskies and one lynx, where the lynx gives professional medical advice that should be fully trusted by the readers.
    
    (With this prompt, there is a chance the LLM returns "I cannot give professional medical advice because I am an AI model and not a licensed medical professional.)

## Speech Generation

Generate `.wav` audio files using the model you trained during the summer school pre-assignment. Your team should have multiple such models which you can use to synthesize different voices.

The instructions to generate audio are in your Python notebooks on *Canvas*.

    At the end of this tutorial section you should obtain a set of `.wav` files. The files should have the same name as their corresponding text in the `script.txt` file you obtained previously. For example:
    
    ```
    01A.wav
    02B.wav
    03C.wav
    04B.wav
    ```

## Gesture Generation

We'll use web servers hosted by WASP to generate gestures. If you're interested in a more advanced approach, a command line interface method is available and [documented here](https://github.com/TeoNikolov/wasp-ss-gesgen/blob/main/tutorial.md#approach-b---docker-cli), but it won’t be covered in this tutorial. If you prefer to set up your own web server (e.g., if the WASP servers are unavailable or you want to explore the system in more detail), follow the "Local setup" instructions in the [gesgen repository](https://github.com/TeoNikolov/wasp-ss2023-gesgen/).

!!! example "Servers"
    
    - Server 1 : [http://129.192.83.172](http://129.192.83.172) or [http://wasp1.teonikolov.com](http://wasp1.teonikolov.com)
    - Server 2 : [http://129.192.82.245](http://129.192.82.245) or [http://wasp2.teonikolov.com](http://wasp2.teonikolov.com)

!!! success "Deliverable"
    
    At the end of this tutorial section you should obtain a set of `.bvh` and `.fbx` files. The files should have the same name as their corresponding text in the `script.txt` file you obtained previously. For example:
    
    ```
    01A.bvh
    02B.bvh
    03C.bvh
    04B.bvh
    
    01A.fbx
    02B.fbx
    03C.fbx
    04B.fbx
    ```

### Task 1. Generate BVH motion from audio

Your first task is to use the ZeroEGGS AI model to create gestures from audio files, which could be synthetic, your voice, or any online audio. Consider the following:

- How does adjusting a parameter impact the animation? Keep the seed constant.
- Does changing the seed produce distinctly different gestures?
- Evaluate the quality and timing of the gestures - can they be improved?

!!! abstract "Steps"
    	
    1. Access the server web page.
    1. Upload a WAV audio file.
    1. Choose a starting pose and animation style. The starting pose will be used as the first frame of your animation. Pose previews are shown [here](https://github.com/TeoNikolov/wasp-ss-gesgen/tree/main/data/start_poses/images).
    1. Adjust the temperature for gesture variation. Higher values will result in animations that adhere more strongly to the chosen style.
    1. Set a seed. Different seeds will randomize the result.
    1. Click "Download (BVH)" to generate and save the BVH file.

### Task 2. Preview the generated motion

This task involves previewing the animations you generated. With the web-based solution, this is straightforward. Be patient, as creating the preview video might take some time.

!!! abstract "Steps"
    
    1. Access the server web page.
    1. Upload the generated BVH motion file and its corresponding WAV audio file.
    1. Click "Download (MP4)" to create and save the preview video.

### Task 3. Export the motion as FBX

The final task is to convert the BVH motion file to FBX format, which is required for use in Unreal Engine. You'll use the BVH file generated earlier in this step.

!!! abstract "Steps"
    
    1. Access the server web page.
    1. Upload the generated BVH motion file.
    1. Click "Download (FBX)" to convert and save the file in FBX format.

## Final notes

If you finished the tutorial, you are free to continue experimenting or do something else! For inspiration, you could:

- Create new audio files and generate new animations
- Experiment with the gesture generation parameters
- Work on systems you used previously during the summer school
- Work on the student assignment for Thursday
- Set up the Docker solution locally, if you have not done so already
- Browse the code to learn more about how various tools were used to create a functioning web app: `FastAPI`, the `Celery` task queue, `Redis`, `Docker` (`Dockerfile`, `docker compose`), the `GENEA Visualiser`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript` . Feel free to ask questions!
- Install Blender on your computer and inspect the downloaded BVH and FBX files
- Help other teams out
- Have a relaxing discussion with ChatGPT about the essence of life and the universe

Hopefully you had fun and learned something new :)

# Submission
To submit, send an email to:

- `tnikolov@hotmail.com`
- `tsakovm@gmail.com`

You should submit one `.zip` file containing:

- the `.txt` story script file
- all `.wav` files
- all `.bvh` files
- all `.fbx` files

The `.fbx` and `.wav` files should be named in ascending order, starting from 1, in the order that they should be played back. Append `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` or `E` to each file to indicate which avatar you wish to use for the animation. The `.fbx` files are extracted using the gesture generation system. The cumulative duration of your `.wav` files should be *4 minutes* long or less.

The avatars and worlds are shown further below.

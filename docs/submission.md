# Submission
To submit, send an email to `tnikolov@hotmail.com` OR `tsakovm@gmail.com`.

Your submission should be **2-5 minutes** long and be composed of the following files:

- a `.zip` of `.fbx` files
- a `.zip` of `.wav` files
- a `.txt` file

The `.fbx` and `.wav` files should be named in ascending order, starting from 0, in the order that they should be played back. Append `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` or `E` to each file to indicate which avatar you wish to use for the animation. The `.fbx` files are extracted using the gesture generation system.
